	Don't cry snowman right in front of me
Who will catch your tears
If you can't catch me darling
If you can't catch me darling
Don't cry snowman don't leave me this way
A puddle of water can't hold me close baby
Can't hold me close baby
I want you to know that I'm never leaving
Cause I'll miss the snow 'till death will be freezing
Yea you are my home my home for all seasons
So come on let's go
Let's go below zero
And hide from the sun
I love you forever
And we'll have some fun
Yes let's hit the north pole
And live happily
Please don't cry no tears now
It's christmas baby
My snowman and me yea
My snowman and me
Baby
Don't cry snowman don't you fear the sun
Who'll carry me without legs to run honey
Without legs to run honey
Don't cry snowman don't you shed a tear
Who'll hear my secrets if you don't have ears baby
If you don't have ears baby
I want you to know that I'm never leaving
Cause I'll miss the snow 'till death will be freezing
You are my home my home for all seasons
So come on let's go
Let's go below zero
And hide from the sun
I love you forever
And we'll have some fun
Yes let's hit the north pole
And live happily
Please don't cry no tears now
It's christmas baby
My snowman and me yea
My snowman and me
Baby
